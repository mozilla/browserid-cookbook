Devise-Persona is a simple Rails app that makes use of Mozilla Persona and Devise for authentication! It's literally just a simple user dashboard and a "Sign in With Persona" button. For upstream development, check out [EasyDash](https://github.com/DeadSuperHero/easydash).

The Devise integration was done using [devise_browserid_authenticatable](https://github.com/denschub/devise_browserid_authenticatable) by [Dennis Schubert](https://github.com/denschub)
